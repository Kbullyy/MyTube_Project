            New BMW is a cinema on Wheels | 2023 i7
        </a>
        <p>We flew to Germany to check out the new BMW i7! Packed with some insane features the<br>
             BMW i7 is one of the most luxurious cars we've ever seen. The i7 defines luxury with a 31<br>
             -inch theatre screen which is controlled by a remote in what BMW calls the master chair in<br>
              the back of the car. Sergi gives us a closer look at the BMW i7 and shows us why it's one of<br>
               the coolest cars in the world.
