            Ford Must GTD in action: Exhaust Sound, Accelerations, Burnouts, Wing DRS & Supercharger Whine!
        </a>
<p>The Mustang GTD is Ford's most extreme Mustang ever created. Unveiled last year, its name comes from the IMSA GTD racing class,<br>
     where the GT3 version of the Mustang competes in the United States. The car in fact can be considered as a Mustang GT3 for the road,<br>
      which however can adopt some technologies, systems and power figures not permitted in the GT3/GTD class, such as adaptive suspension<br> and active aerodynamics.
    The heart of the Mustang GTD is a supercharged 5.2-liter V8 which is able to produce 800 hp. The car adopts a<br>
     transaxle gearbox meaning the transmission is at the rear, contributing to the car's near 50-50 weight distribution. It's an eight-speed dual-<br>
     clutch unit, and a carbon fiber driveshaft sends the power from the engine to the transaxle. The GTD rides on Ford describes as a semi-active<br>
      suspension that can adjust the spring rates and ride height. The front setup consists of a short-long arm layout. There's no longer storage in the<br>
       trunk because the pushrod and rocker arm architecture, hydraulic control system, and transaxle cooling system are back there. Air scoops funnel<br>
        air off the back glass to cool this area.
    The GTD is also equipped with a Drag Reduction System, which uses a hydraulic system that can change<br>
     the angle of the rear wing and activate flaps under the front of the car to find exactly the right balance between airflow for speed and downforce<br>
      for grip, depending on performance conditions. 
    Not much more has been revealed about the car, which aim to make a time under 7 minutes on<br>
     the famous NÃ¼rburgring Nordschleife. Production of Mustang GTD will be limited and Multimatic will handle the final assembly of the car.<br><br>
    Watch and hear it in action during the 2024 Goodwood Festival of Speed!
