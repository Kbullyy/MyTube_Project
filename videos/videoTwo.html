<p>Cletus McFarlane for president!  He is not afraid to show power, while showing immense speed<br>
being able to handle things quickly and confidently.  Cletus has taken a RAM TRX and made it<br>
a two door.  Adding on to the awesomeness, he goes and swaps the supercharged Hellcat engine<br>
for a Hellephant C170 engine.  Needless to say the truck runs amazing and you should see for<br>
yourself!</p>
