            1,000hp Dodge Charger v 1,000hp Dodge RAM: DRAG RACE
        </a>
<p>It’s time for an all-American showdown! 
    Mat and Racing Driver Sam have flown over<br>
     to Texas to get their hands on a pair of Hennessy powerhouses, and they’re set to go head<br>
     -to-head on Hennessey’s own drag strip! 
    So let’s see how these two contenders compare.<br>
     First off, we have Mat in the Hennessey Mammoth, which is based on the Dodge RAM TRX. It comes with a 6.2-litre supercharged V8, but the power output has been increased to 1,012hp and 1,314Nm of torque! Power is sent to all four wheels via an 8-speed automatic gearbox, and this HUGE pick-up tips the scales at 2,921kg! 
    Then we have the Hennessey H1000 Charger. It comes with pretty much the same engine as the Mammoth, so it has a 6.2-litre supercharged V8 that can put down 1,000hp and 1,285Nm. It comes with an 8-speed automatic gearbox that sends power to the rear wheels only, and it weighs in at 2,086kg. 
    So the Charger isn’t exactly light, but will the weight difference prove decisive over the quarter-mile? There’s only one way to find out… LET’S RACE!
